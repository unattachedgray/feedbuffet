      "description": "This picture shows Lee Hye-hoon, who was nominated as the first minister of the to-be-established Ministry of Planning and Budget. [YONHAP] Former lawmaker Lee Hye-hoon, a figure from the conservative bloc, was nominated on Sunday to serve as the first minister of the to-be-established Ministry of Planning and Budget. Public Communications Secretary Lee Kyu-youn announced the nomination during a press briefing on Sunday.

She also ran as a PPP candidate in the 2024 general election. “The nominee has extensive experience in both policy and practice, having served as a member of the National Assembly’s Special Committee on Budget and Accounts and as a research fellow at the Korea Development Institute,\" Lee Kyu-youn said. “She led legislative efforts to revise the Minimum Wage Act and the Interest Limitation Act based on a philosophy of economic democratization. She also pushed for policies to eliminate unfair trade practices and improve livelihoods. \"Based on her four years of legislative experience, we believe she is well-suited to lead the soon-to-be-launched Ministry of Planning and Budget in crafting long-term national strategies and helping restore momentum for future growth.” President Lee Jae Myung also appointed former lawmaker Kim Sung-sik as vice chair of the National Economic Advisory Council and Lee Gyung-su, chairman of nuclear fusion technology company EnableFusion, as vice chair of the Presidential Advisory Council on Science and Technology. Former lawmaker Kim served two terms in the National Assembly, representing the conservative Grand National Party, the People’s Party and Bareunmirae Party. “Kim has demonstrated strong policy expertise as a ranking member of the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee and chairman of the Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution,\" Lee Kyu-youn said. “He is seen as someone capable of leading efforts to overcome the structural economic crisis and drive various innovation agendas, including the AI transition.\" Asked about the decision to appoint two figures from the conservative bloc — Lee Hye-hoon and Kim Sung-sik — Lee Gyu-yeon said the president’s personnel philosophy rests on two core principles: “inclusion and pragmatism.” “I believe those principles are reflected in this round of nominations as well,” Lee Gyu-yeon said. “These individuals are widely recognized as experts in the fields of economics and budgeting, and they are well equipped with hands-on experience and practical expertise.” Kim Sung-sik speaks during a press conference at the National Assembly in western Seoul on March 3, 2020. [YONHAP] President Lee made additional appointments to the Cabinet. Kim Jong-gu, former director-general of the Agricultural Policy Bureau at the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, was named vice minister of the ministry.
