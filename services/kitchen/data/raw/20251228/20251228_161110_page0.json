      "title": "What make women 'attractive'? Science decodes traits of females from top lists. Here's what was common",
      "description": "A data analysis by PlayersTime examined nearly a decade of Maxims Hot 100 lists to identify recurring traits linked to modern perceptions of attractiveness. Instead of naming a single individual, the study created a statistical profile showing common features such as brown eyes, long brown hair, a heart-shaped face, a slim build, and the presence of tattoos. The research also found that most women featured were in their late twenties and had not undergone cosmetic surgery.",
