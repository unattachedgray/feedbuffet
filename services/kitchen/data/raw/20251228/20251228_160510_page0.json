      "description": "Tens of thousands flooded the streets of Tel Aviv as anger boiled over against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, months after the devastating October 7 Hamas attack.

The demonstrations reflect a deepening crisis of trust, with families of victims and ordinary Israelis accusing the government of evasion and political survival over accountability. “I come here to protest to try to get this terrible government out of the way and have some hope for Israel for the future,” says protester Rina Tenenbaum, as chants, placards, and raw emotion dominate the streets.",
